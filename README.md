Fashion MNIST Classification Project
Overview
This project involves training a neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset and deploying a FastAPI server to make predictions on new images. The steps include data preprocessing, model training, saving the trained model, and setting up an API endpoint for image classification.

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable) or create a project directory:

sh
Copy code
mkdir fashion_mnist_classification
cd fashion_mnist_classification
Create and activate a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib fastapi uvicorn pillow nest_asyncio
Training the Model
Download and preprocess the dataset, define the model, and train it. Save the following script as train_model.py:

# Load datasets

# Define the model

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
# Train the model

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'fashion_mnist_model.pth')

# Visualize some sample images
dataiter = iter(trainloader)
images, labels = next(dataiter)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(6):
    plt.subplot(2,3,i+1)
    plt.imshow(images[i].numpy().squeeze(), cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Label: {labels[i]}")
plt.show()
Run the training script:

sh
Copy code
python train_model.py
Running the FastAPI Server
Save the following script as app.py:
Making Predictions
To make predictions, you can use a tool like curl or Postman to send a POST request to the /model/prediction endpoint with an image file. For example, using curl
